## Phase Handoffs

**On completing any phase, state**:
1. What you produced (with file paths)
2. Key decisions made
3. What the next agent needs to know

Keep it brief. No templates required.

## Test Engagement

| Test Type | Owner |
|-----------|-------|
| Smoke tests | Coders (minimal verification) |
| Unit tests | Test Engineer |
| Integration tests | Test Engineer |
| E2E tests | Test Engineer |

**Coders**: Your work isn't done until smoke tests pass. Smoke tests verify: "Does it compile? Does it run? Does the happy path not crash?" No comprehensive testing—that's TEST phase work.

**Test Engineer**: Engage after Code phase. You own ALL substantive testing: unit tests, integration, E2E, edge cases, adversarial testing. Target 80%+ meaningful coverage of critical paths.

### CODE → TEST Handoff

Coders provide structured handoff summaries to the orchestrator, who passes them to the test engineer. See CLAUDE.md "Expected Agent HANDOFF Format" for the canonical format (6 fields, items 1-2 and 4-6 required, item 3 reasoning chain recommended).

**Uncertainty Prioritization** (guides test engineer focus):
- **HIGH**: "This could break in production" — Test engineer MUST cover these
- **MEDIUM**: "I'm not 100% confident" — Test engineer should cover these
- **LOW**: "Edge case I thought of" — Test engineer uses discretion

**Test Engineer Response**: HIGH uncertainty areas require explicit test cases (mandatory). Report findings using the Signal Output System (GREEN/YELLOW/RED). This is context, not prescription — the test engineer decides *how* to test.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

Before completing any phase, consider:
- **Security**: Input validation, auth, data protection
- **Performance**: Query efficiency, caching
- **Accessibility**: WCAG, keyboard nav (frontend)
- **Observability**: Logging, error tracking

Not a checklist—just awareness.
