Summary: Shared constants and utilities for the merge guard hook pair.
Used by: merge_guard_pre.py (PreToolUse) and merge_guard_post.py (PostToolUse)

Centralizes TOKEN_TTL, TOKEN_DIR, TOKEN_PREFIX, consumed-token cleanup,
the regex-prefix constants (_GH_PREFIX, _GIT_PREFIX, etc.) and the
canonical destructive-command operation-type classifier
detect_command_operation_type. Both hooks call this classifier on the
SAME input when the prose-embed convention holds, guaranteeing
bidirectional write/read classification agreement (issue #720 Bug B).

Token-lifecycle invariants (pinned by tests/test_merge_guard.py class
TestTokenLifecycleInvariants):

  I-1 (at most one unused token at any time):
      cleanup_unused_tokens() is called from write_token() BEFORE
      os.open(O_EXCL). Any prior unused token is atomically renamed to
      .consumed before the new one exists on disk.

  I-2 (successful operation immediately retires the token):
      merge_guard_post.main() Bash branch detects successful
      `gh pr merge` (dict-shape tool_response + interrupted=false +
      op_type=merge + "Merged pull request" in stdout) and atomically
      renames the consuming token to .consumed regardless of MAX_USES.

  I-3 (TTL expiry retires the token):
      merge_guard_pre.find_valid_token enforces `expires_at < now` and
      removes expired tokens via _safe_remove. Audit-only invariant in
      this module (no helper here; pinned by alias test).

  I-4 (failed operation preserves token for retry within TTL up to MAX_USES):
      merge_guard_pre._consume_token N-use slot semantics. .use-N
      markers atomically claim slots via O_EXCL; final slot triggers
      terminal .consumed rename. Audit-only invariant in this module.

  I-5 (cross-session tokens never valid):
      merge_guard_pre.find_valid_token enforces
      current_session == token_session when both are present. Audit-
      only invariant in this module.

Cross-cutting cleanup: cleanup_orphan_tokens() reaps unconsumed tokens
whose mtime exceeds ORPHAN_TOKEN_MAX_AGE_SECONDS (12x TOKEN_TTL).
Triggered from merge_guard_pre.find_valid_token (primary, load-bearing
on every dangerous-Bash precheck) and session_init.main (secondary,
eager-cleanup at session start). Disk-hygiene defense — not a primary
security check; the primary check is I-3 TTL expiry at 5 minutes.
