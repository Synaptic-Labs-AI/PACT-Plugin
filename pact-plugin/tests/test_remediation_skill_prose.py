"""
Agent-facing prose that must agree with what the pact-memory code emits.

Location: pact-plugin/tests/test_remediation_skill_prose.py

The pact-memory SKILL.md and the secretary's agent file are loaded into agent
sessions as instructions. When they describe an envelope field or an exit code
the code does not produce, an agent looks for a key that is not there or reads
a failure as something else. Each arm here binds one load-bearing clause.

HOW THE ARMS READ THE PROSE. Markdown heading lines are dropped before any
search, so a heading cannot satisfy its own clause. Backticks are removed and
whitespace is collapsed on both sides, so a re-wrap or a backtick change does
not red an arm, while a deleted or inverted clause does.
